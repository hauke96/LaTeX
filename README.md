# LaTeX
All LaTeX things which might be useful and should be published.
# Installation
Use the install script `install.sh` to install the latest files to your `texlive` environment. This script uses the remote files from github and _not_ the ones of your local repository!
# Download (to local folder)
Instead of installing the packages, you can use the `download.sh` script to just download the packaged to the folder this script is in.
